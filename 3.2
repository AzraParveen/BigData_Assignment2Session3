3.2.1 >>>>>



Now we need to create a file named max-temp.txt for that following command will be used :

>   touch max-temp.txt

touch command will create a empty file named max-temp.txt now we have to add 10-15 records.
for inserting data into file nano command will be used.

>  nano max-temp.txt

after inserting data we need to save that for that we will press control+x followed by y(yes)
to save and than exit.

now if we want to check the data in our file we will use cat command followed by file name

>  cat max-temp.txt



3.2.2 >>>>>

Now we have to copy the above max-temp.txt file from the local file system to HDFS in the
/user/acadgild/hadoop path.For this we will use put command as follow:

>  hadoop fs -put max-temp.txt /user/acadgild/hadoop/max-temp.txt

now i have copied max-temp.txt file to HDFS ,now i have to check it worked or not.so i will
check in browser and shared screenshot shows that it is copied to HDFS.



3.2.3 >>>>>

now we need to change the permission of our file max-temp.txt such that only owner and group of
members should have r-w-x(read,write,execute) other should have only read permission.
To change the permissions we will use chmod command as follows.

> hadoop fs -chmod 774 /user/acadgild/hadoop/max-temp.txt

here 7 represents read,write execute all permissions to be granted while 4 represents only read 
permission is granted to others. where the position defines that for owner and group of members 
have all read,write and execute while others only have read permission.

now we have to check permission granted or not for that we will use following command :

> hadoop fs -ls /user/acadgild/hadoop/max-temp.txt

the attached screenshot file shows that permission granted according to the problem to user,group and
others.
